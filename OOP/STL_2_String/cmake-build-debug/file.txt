Well, kiss me, kiss me,
Even to the     point of blood, ev25en to the point of pain.
At odds with cold will
Boiling water of the     heart jets.

An overturned mug
Among the merry ones is not for us.
Understand, my friend,
They live on earth only once!

Look around with a calm gaze,
Look: there is a damp
Moon in the darkness, like a yellow raven,
Circling, curling above the ground.

Come on, kiss me! That's what I want.
He sang a song to me, too.
He must have s4ensed my death.
The one who winds in the sky.

Withering p1ower!
To die is to die!
Before the death of the sweet lips
I would like to kiss.

To be in blue slumbers all the time,
Without shame and without melting,
In the gentle rustle of wild cherry trees
It was heard: "I am yours."

And let the light over the full mug
It did not go o2ut with a light foam
Drink and sing, my friend:
They live on earth only once!
